## Add Collaborators

Now that you've created your own fork, if another member within your team wants to contribute to the code, you would need to add them as a collaborator.

To do so, navigate to the repository containing your fork and click on `Settings`:

Then select the `Collaborators` option in the navigation menu on the left:

Select `Add people`:

And search for the `username`, `full name`, or `email` of the member you want to add to the repository.

Then they can clone your repository and contribute code to your fork.

Now you're ready to start. Happy coding!
